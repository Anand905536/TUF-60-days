Solution 3:Optimal Solution(Two pointer approach)

Approach: Take 2 pointer l(left pointer) and r(right pointer) pointing to 0th and (n-1)th index respectively.
Take two variables leftMax and rightMax and initialise it to 0.
If heigh[l] is less than or equal to height[r] then if leftMax is
less then height[l] update leftMax to height[l] else add leftMax-height[l] to 
your final answer and move the l pointer to the right i.e l++.If height[r] is less then height[l],
then now we are dealing with the right block.If height[r] is greater then rightMax,
then update rightMax to height[r] else add rightMax-height[r] to the final answer.Now move r to the left.
Repeat theses steps till l and r crosses each other.

Intuition: We need a minimum of leftMax and rightMax.
So if we take the case when height[l]<=height[r] we increase l++, 
so we can surely say that there is a block with height more than height[l] to the right of l.
And for the same reason when height[r]<=height[l] we can surely say that there is a block to the left of r which is at least of height height[r].
So by traversing with these cases and using two pointers approach the time complexity can be decreased without using extra space.

Code:

import java.util.*;
class TUF {
    static int trap(int[] height) {
        int n = height.length;
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;
        int res = 0;
        int maxLeft = 0, maxRight = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            if (height[left] <= height[right]) {
                if (height[left] >= maxLeft) {
                    maxLeft = height[left];
                } else {
                    res += maxLeft - height[left];
                }
                left++;
            } else {
                if (height[right] >= maxRight) {
                    maxRight = height[right];
                } else {
                    res += maxRight - height[right];
                }
                right--;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }


    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int arr[] = {0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1};
        System.out.println("The duplicate element is " + trap(arr));
    }
}
Output: The water that can be trapped is 6

Time Complexity: O(N) because we are using 2 pointer approach.

Space Complexity: O(1) because we are not using anything extra.
